# Start Development Server

Start the app so you can see it in your browser.

## Steps

1. **Check if setup was run** - Look for `node_modules` folder
   - If missing, tell the user: "Let's set things up first! Run `/setup` and come back here."

2. **Start the server** - Run `pnpm run dev` as a background process

3. **Tell the user**:
   - 🚀 Your app is starting!
   - Open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser to see it
   - Changes you make will automatically refresh in the browser
   - To stop the server, press Ctrl+C in the terminal or close it

## Tone

Be enthusiastic! This is exciting - they're about to see their app running. Keep it simple and clear.
