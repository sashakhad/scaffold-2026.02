# ESLint Autofix-First Workflow

When fixing lint errors, always let ESLint's autofix handle what it can before making manual changes.

## Process

1. **Run autofix first**: `pnpm run lint:fix` (or `pnpm eslint --fix <file>` for a single file)
2. **Check what remains**: `pnpm run lint` to see any errors that autofix couldn't resolve
3. **Manually fix only the remaining errors** that ESLint could not auto-fix

## Why

- ESLint's fixer produces consistent, predictable output
- Manual edits risk introducing formatting drift or style inconsistencies
- Autofix handles the mechanical stuff (semicolons, quotes, spacing, import order) so you focus on the real issues (unused vars, type errors, logic bugs)

## Important

- Do NOT manually fix errors that ESLint can auto-fix (formatting, trailing commas, etc.)
- Do NOT skip the autofix step and jump straight to manual edits
- After manual fixes, run `pnpm run lint` again to confirm zero remaining errors
