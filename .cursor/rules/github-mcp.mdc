## PR Management

- All MCP-created PRs must include `[Bot]` in the description.
- PR titles should clearly indicate MCP origin, e.g., `fix(example): [Bot] update config for MCP`.
- MCP must not merge PRs; only open, update, or close as instructed by a maintainer.
- MCP should update PR descriptions to reflect the latest changes and diff summary.

## Issue Management

- MCP may open issues for automation errors or workflow failures, but must assign to `@maintainers`.
- Issues created by MCP should include `[Bot]` in the title or body for transparency.
- MCP should not close issues unless explicitly instructed.

## Bot Etiquette

- All comments by MCP must start with `[Bot]` for transparency.
- MCP should respond inline to specific PR comments when addressing feedback.
- MCP should never delete user comments or override human feedback.

## Error Handling

- On error, MCP should notify maintainers via issue or PR comment, including error details and steps taken.
- MCP should not attempt destructive actions (e.g., force-push, branch deletion) on error.

## Security & Permissions

- MCP must never force-push or delete branches.
- MCP should only operate within its assigned permissions and never escalate privileges.

## Change Management

- Changes to this rules file must be made via PR and require review by a maintainer.
- All updates to MCP automation logic should be documented in this file or linked documentation.
