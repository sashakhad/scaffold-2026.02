# Rule Creation Guidelines

## Required Structure for New Rules

- Every rule file **must** start with a YAML frontmatter block containing:
  - `description`: A short summary of the rule's purpose.
  - `globs`: File patterns (as a YAML list or object) indicating where the rule applies.
  - `alwaysApply`: Whether the rule should always be considered (true/false).
- The YAML frontmatter must be at the very top of the file, before any Markdown content.
- The main content should use Markdown, with clear sections and examples as appropriate.
- Use headings for clarity (e.g., `#`, `##`, `###`).
- Include rationale and migration/usage notes if relevant.

## Example Rule File

```
---
description: Example rule for demonstration.
globs:
  - 'src/**/*'
alwaysApply: false
---

# Example Rule

- Follow this pattern for all new rules.
```

## Commit Process

- Add new rules in a dedicated commit with a clear message, e.g., `rules(<rule-name>): add rule for ...`.
- If standardizing or updating rules, use a separate commit, e.g., `chore(rules): standardize YAML frontmatter and globs in all Cursor rules files`.

## Rationale

- Consistent rule files improve discoverability and automation.
- Clear structure helps both humans and tools understand and enforce project standards.
